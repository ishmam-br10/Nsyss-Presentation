abstract = {Addiction to social media application is an alarming state of condition where other psychological problems can be shown. This paper presents an analysis between the relationship of social media use to mental health issues in 262 adolescents. In this study, we applied Structural Engineering Modeling (SEM) to analyze factors of social media addiction and how it contributes to mental health issues. We measured mobile usage, emotional investment on social media, sleep quality, self-esteem and levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Results implies that those people who are highly invested in social media experienced poor sleep quality, lower self-esteem and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression. These findings suggest that excessive use of smartphones due to social media can be linked to negative psychological characteristics and possibly lead to suicidal ideation.},

abstract = {Personal social media usage is pervasive in both personal and professional lives. Practitioner articles and news stories have commented on the addicting and distracting nature of social media. Previous empirical research has established the negative effects of distractions on primary tasks. To date, little research has looked at the potentially distracting nature of social media and the negative effects that can arise from usage. This research addresses this gap by investigating the effects of personal social media usage on task performance. To extend this research, I also examined the effects that the personal social media usage has on individuals’ technostress and happiness levels. I tested these effects by creating a classroom task environment and measuring subjects’ usage of social media and their task performance. From this, it was found that higher amounts of personal social media usage led to lower performance on the task, as well as higher levels of technostress and lower happiness. These results are consistent across different levels of attentional control and multitasking computer self-efficacy. These results suggest that the personal usage of social media during professional (vs. personal or play) times can lead to negative consequences and is worthy of further study.}
