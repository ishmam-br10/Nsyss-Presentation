# Description
This study investigates the relationship between social media addiction and studentsâ€™ academic satisfaction, utilizing survey data collected through Google Forms from 943 respondents. We applied several machine learning models, including XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting, to predict student satisfaction regarding their academic standing in the context of social media addiction. The XGBoost model emerged as the best performer, prompting the application of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to elucidate the factors influencing its predictions. The insights gained from this research will contribute to future interventions aimed at supporting socially media-addicted individuals facing academic dissatisfaction, enabling the identification of key factors through our survey, predictive modeling, and explainable AI (XAI) implementation.
